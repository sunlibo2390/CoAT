Below the search bar, there is a list of previous searches related to job searching, like \"job search apps for teenagers,\" \"job apps,\" \"indeed flex,\" \"ziprecruiter app,\" \"job games,\" and \"indeed job search application.\" The time at the top indicates it's 9:30, and the phone has some notifications and a partial battery charge.
