Scrolling is necessary to browse through all available apps to locate a specific one or to get to the store app where one can install new apps. This action is a step forward towards completing the user request, since it might bring the Play Store icon into view, which is typically used to install new apps like \"Lyft - Rideshare, Bikes, Scooters & Transit\" on an Android device. However, in the current screenshot, the Play Store icon is still not visible, so further action would be needed to either continue scrolling or to locate and open the Play Store through another method.",
