    "action_think": "To install the app 'Lyft - Rideshare, Bikes, Scooters & Transit', I need to open the Google Play Store where most Android apps can be found and downloaded. On the current screen, the Google Play Store is not immediately visible, but based on common Android device configurations, it can usually be found among the apps on the home screen or in the app drawer. Since I am already on the home screen and the Play Store is not visible here, I should navigate to the app drawer by clicking on the white circle with six dots at the bottom center which represents the app drawer icon.",
