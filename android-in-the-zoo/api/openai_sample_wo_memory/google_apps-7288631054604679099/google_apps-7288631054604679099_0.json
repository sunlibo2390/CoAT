Common actions to access settings from the home screen include using the app drawer to find the settings app or pulling down the notification tray where a settings shortcut is typically available. Since neither of these options is visible in the current screenshot, the next reasonable action would be to open the app drawer or attempt accessing the notification tray to find the settings icon.",
