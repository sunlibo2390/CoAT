The next part of the user's request is to search for 'razer thresher' on Amazon, select the first entry, and add it to the cart. To continue, I should begin by searching for 'razer thresher' on Amazon. Since the search bar is already selected and previously searched items 'macbook air' and 'macbook pro' are displayed, the next logical action is to clear the search bar and enter the new search query.",

The current screen shows the search bar with suggested searches such as \"macbook air\" and \"macbook pro,\" indicating that the input area is ready for a new search term. This has made progress towards the user's request to search for a \"razer thresher\" on Amazon, as the next step would be to enter the search term \"razer thresher\" into the input area. However, it's important to note that the user's initial request also included emptying the shopping cart, which has not been addressed yet. The current screen still shows that the Amazon cart is empty, which indicates that no further action is needed to empty the cart.
