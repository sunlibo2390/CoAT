To uninstall an app, typically, one would go to the app's page in the Google Play Store and use the uninstall button, or find the app in the device settings under Apps and uninstall it from there. Since we're already in the Google Play Store, the quickest method would be to search for 'Google Translate' again and access its store page directly from there. After the app's store page is open, the uninstall option should be visible.",
