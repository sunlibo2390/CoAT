The screenshot doesn't show Google News directly on the home screen, so the next step is to find the news app. There might be a news app placed in the app drawer or among other pages on the home screen. The most straightforward next step is to open the app drawer, as that's where all apps are stored if not on the home screen itself.",

This action has opened the Google app which is a gateway to accessing recent news through its search or discover features. Therefore, this action has made progress towards the completion of the user's request because they can now use the search bar to enter a query related to recent news, or explore the 'Discover' section which typically includes recent news articles and trending topics."
