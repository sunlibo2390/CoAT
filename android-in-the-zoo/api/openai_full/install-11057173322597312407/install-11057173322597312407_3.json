There is no direct indication that the 'Microsoft Excel' app is present on this screen, and the screenshot does not show the home screen or app drawer where the app could be located.

In the current screenshot, we can see the Expedia app at the top of the list, followed by other apps including \"Facebook\" and \"Microsoft Authenticator,\" which suggests that the search terms from the last action have been cleared, indicating readiness for a new search query.\n\nThis action aligns with the progress towards the user's request to open the app \"Microsoft Excel\" because it is now possible to enter \"Microsoft Excel\" into the search input area to find and open the app. The search bar in the current screenshot reads \"Search for apps & games,\" which is the correct context for locating an application like Microsoft Excel on the device. However, please note that the final step of fulfilling the user's request would involve typing \"Microsoft Excel\" into the search bar, obtaining the search results, and selecting the correct app from those results to open it."
