However, the search conducted was for the \"airtel thanks app\" and not for \"Pinterest\" which is the app requested by the user.\n\nThis action has not made progress towards the user request because the app that needs to be installed is \"Pinterest,\" not \"airtel thanks.\" To progress towards completing the user request, I would need to use the search bar at the top of the Play Store screen to look for the \"Pinterest\" app and then proceed with the installation process."
