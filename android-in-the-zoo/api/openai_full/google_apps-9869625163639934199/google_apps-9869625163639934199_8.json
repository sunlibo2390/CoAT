There are buttons for installation and sharing, as well as indicators for the app's rating (4.1 stars), number of reviews, and number of downloads (10M+). Below these details, there's a brief description stating it is for \"Inspiration for new recipes, fashion tips & design ideas \u2014 in a smaller app.\" At the bottom, users can view ratings and reviews from other users.",
    "action_think": "The user has requested to install the 'Pinterest' app. The current page is for 'Pinterest Lite', a lighter version of Pinterest. Although the user requested 'Pinterest', installing 'Pinterest Lite' may satisfy the request if the user accepted this alternative version. However, if the intent was to install the original 'Pinterest' app, I should search for 'Pinterest' instead of 'Pinterest Lite'. Since the history actions do not indicate the user's preference for the Lite version explicitly, I should ideally navigate back to the search results and select the standard 'Pinterest' app. The next single-step action would be to press the back arrow to return to the search results and select the correct app.",

This directly aligns with the user's request to install the app \"Pinterest.\" The installation progress has been completed, and the user can now open and use the app."
