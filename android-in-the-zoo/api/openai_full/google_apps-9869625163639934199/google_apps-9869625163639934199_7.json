The results listed include various apps related to Pinterest, such as \"Pinterest Lite,\" \"Pinterest TV Studio,\" \"Video Downloader For Pinterest,\" as well as other apps with similar functionality. Each app listing includes the app name, the app icon, the developer, and the app rating. It appears the user can browse through these results and possibly download the apps.",

The action has made progress towards the user's request to install the app \"Pinterest\" by bringing the user to the correct page where they can begin the installation process.
