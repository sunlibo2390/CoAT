Below this, there is a section titled \"RECENT LOCATION REQUESTS\" that lists applications which have recently requested location access, specifically \"Google\" and \"Maps.\" There is an option to \"See all\" for more details. Additionally, the screen indicates that 4 out of 13 apps have access to location data, and there are toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning at the bottom.",
    "action_think": "The user has requested to turn off the 'Improve location accuracy' feature. On the current screen, the 'Wi-Fi scanning' and 'Bluetooth scanning' toggles at the bottom are features associated with enhancing location accuracy. However, these toggles are already turned off as indicated by their inactive state. Since the toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning are the most common features related to improving location accuracy and they are already disabled, it is likely that the 'Improve location accuracy' setting if separate, is not directly visible on this screen. The next logical step would be to search for the 'Improve location accuracy' setting within the Location settings. Typically, this might be found in an advanced section of the Location settings or by further exploring the options available on the current screen.",

The \"Improve location accuracy\" setting may be hidden within these advanced settings, and scrolling up has made more of these settings accessible.\n\nThis action is a step towards completing the user request, as it allows the user to see the relevant options to disable location accuracy improvements. However, further action is required to disable the specific \"Improve location accuracy\" setting or adjust related options like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth scanning."
