Once the first item is added to the cart, I will need to empty the shopping cart to fulfill the user's request.

The expanded information includes the store address, opening times, and a link to find another store. \n\nThis action, however, has not made progress towards the user request of emptying the shopping cart, searching for \"MacBook Air,\" selecting the first entry, and adding it to the cart. The current screen is still showing the search results for \"MacBook Air\" on bestbuy.com, but no interactions with the shopping cart or product listings have been made yet. To continue towards completing the user's request, the next step would be to interact with the product listings (specifically the first entry of the MacBook Air) and perform actions related to adding it to the shopping cart."
