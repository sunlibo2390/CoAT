The consequence of this action is evident in the current screenshot, which shows that the cart is currently empty (\"Your cart is empty\"). This has made progress towards the user request in terms of confirming that the shopping cart is empty, which was the first part of the user's request.\n\nHowever, to fully complete the user's request, the next steps would involve searching for \"macbook air\" on the Best Buy website, selecting the first entry in the search results, and then adding that item to the shopping cart. As the cart is verified to be empty, I can now proceed with the second part of the user's request; to begin this part, I should navigate back to the main page or use the search bar at the top of the page to search for \"macbook air.\""
