This is evident in the current screenshot, where the \"Install\" button has changed to an \"Open\" button, and the text \"Installed\" appears beneath the app icon. This action has made progress towards the user request, as installing the app is the prerequisite step to opening it and entering the requested username and password. However, the user request has not been fully completed yet; the next step would be to open the app and proceed with the login process."
