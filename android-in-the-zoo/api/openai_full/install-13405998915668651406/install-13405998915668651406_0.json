There's a dock at the bottom containing four app icons: Phone, Messages, Google Play, and Camera, which offer quick access to their respective functions. Lastly, a Google search bar sits at the very bottom, just above the navigation bar which includes a back button, home button, and a recent apps button.",

However, it seems that the term \"zoom cloud meetings\" was previously searched for, and the results for this search are currently being displayed.\n\nThis action is a step towards the user request, as opening the Google Play Store is necessary to install the requested app \"PlayWell.\" However, the current view does not show any progress towards finding or installing \"PlayWell\" nor entering the username and password as requested. The next step should be clearing the current search and entering \"PlayWell\" into the search bar to locate the correct app. If \"PlayWell\" is then found, the next steps would involve installing it, opening it, and entering the username \"metric@gmail.com\" and the password \"bumblebee\" as instructed by the user request."
