It displays a product image, pricing at $64.99, and an offer to protect the computer accessory with Geek Squad\u00ae Product Replacement, highlighting coverage for accidental damage, normal wear and tear, and Bluetooth connectivity issues. The screen includes customer ratings for the protection plan and options to continue shopping or go to the cart, with a \"Go to Cart\" button prominently displayed at the bottom. Also, there's a cart subtotal reflecting the price of the added item.",

We can see the shopping cart interface now, with an itemized list and a total price.\n\nThis action has not progressed toward the original user request of emptying the cart because the cart still contains an item, as indicated by the total price shown ($68.56). However, it is a necessary step before the cart can be emptied. To complete the user request, the next action would be to remove the item(s) from the cart. Once the cart is empty, the next steps would include searching for \"razer kraken\" on the Best Buy website, selecting the first entry, adding it to the cart, and then proceeding to checkout."
