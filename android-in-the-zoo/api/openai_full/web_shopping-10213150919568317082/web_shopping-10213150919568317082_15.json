This action has made progress towards the completion of the user request; with the \"Checkout\" button now visible, the user can proceed to decide on the payment and complete the purchase process if desired. However, it is important to note that the user's primary request is to empty the shopping cart, which has not been addressed yet. The visible cart currently still contains items, as indicated by the total price of $68.56. Hence, the next step should involve removing those items from the cart before proceeding to search for the Razer Kraken product as requested."
