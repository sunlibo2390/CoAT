The current screen shows that the user has navigated to the returning customer login page. Since filling in the login credentials and signing in could be outside my capabilities as an AI, I need to plan out the steps to return to the cart without logging in and then proceed to remove the item. The user can return to the shopping cart either by clicking the 'Return to cart' link at the top right corner of the screen or navigating back using the browser's back button until the shopping cart is reached. The detailed future actions would involve getting back to the shopping cart, finding the option to remove the item from the cart, and confirming the action to empty the cart.",
