Icons for commonly used apps like Photos, YouTube, Reddit, Google Maps, and the Google Play Store can be seen towards the top of the screen. Other apps such as Camera, Chat, Google Chrome, Clock, ColorNote, Contacts, and Drive are also visible, among others. The phone's status bar at the top displays the time, battery status, and connectivity indicators such as Wi-Fi and mobile signal strength.",

Since the app drawer typically displays apps in alphabetical order and 'Walmart' would likely appear towards the end, scrolling down may reveal the app if it is installed. To proceed, I need to locate the app first.",

This is visible by the transition from the list of apps on the home screen in the last screenshot to the Play Store interface in the current screenshot. However, the current screen shows the PlayWell app instead of the \"Walmart Shopping & Grocery\" app, which the user wants to uninstall. At this point, I have not made progress towards completing the user's request because the next step should be locating and selecting the \"Walmart Shopping & Grocery\" app within the Play Store and then choosing the option to uninstall it. To proceed correctly, I would need to use the search function in the Play Store or navigate to \"My apps & games\" to find the \"Walmart Shopping & Grocery\" app."
