However, the current screenshot indicates a search query for 'playwell' which is unrelated to the user's request.

Now, a new search term \"Walmart Shopping & Grocery\" has been entered into the search input area. This action brings us closer to completing the user request because it is the first step in finding the application that the user wants to uninstall from the device. The next steps would involve locating the app in the search results, selecting it, and then proceeding with the uninstallation process."
