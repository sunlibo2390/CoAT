The \"Maps\" app icon is visible in the center, with three apps at the bottom: Messages, Chrome, and Google Assistant.

    "action_think": "The user wants to toggle the notifications on the lock screen. To do this, we need to access the phone settings. Looking at the current screen, there isn't a direct shortcut to settings visible, so the general way to access settings on an Android device would be through the app drawer or a notification panel swipe-down gesture. Since the former is not visible, we will use the swipe-down gesture to open the notification panel, which commonly has a gear-shaped settings icon.",

This action does not directly contribute to the user request of toggling notifications on the lock screen. The next step would be to find the settings app or the \"Notifications\" option, and from there, adjust the lock screen settings. Thus, this action has not yet made significant progress toward completing the user request."
