It includes options for managing sound, storage, privacy, location, security, accounts, accessibility, Google services, and system preferences. Each section provides specific settings, such as storage usage, screen lock options, location access, and language settings. The interface is organized with icons and descriptive text for each feature.",
    "action_think": "According to the user request to toggle the setting to show notifications on the lock screen, I need to find the appropriate settings section where this option might be located. The correct section for this setting is typically 'Security' as it pertains to the lock screen settings. In the current screen, I can see the option for 'Security' which might include the lock screen settings where the notifications toggle could be found. The plan is to navigate to 'Security' and then look for the 'Notifications' or 'Lock screen preferences' within that section to find the specific toggle for showing notifications on the lock screen.",

However, the option to toggle notifications on the lock screen has not appeared yet. The action made progress towards the user request by navigating down the settings menu, where such an option is likely to be found, but further actions are required to locate and toggle the specific setting for showing notifications on the lock screen. To complete the user request, we need to continue scrolling through the settings or navigate to a specific section where lock screen settings are adjustable."
