It shows options for configuring network and internet, connected devices, apps and notifications, battery status, display settings, sound, and storage usage.

Based on the current screen, this option is most likely found under 'Apps & notifications' or 'Display' settings. Since we have already scrolled down, 'Display' seems the most relevant, as it includes settings related to lock screen behavior. We should proceed by selecting the 'Display' option to find the appropriate settings to toggle notifications on the lock screen.",

    "action_result": "By clicking on \"Apps & notifications\" in the previous screen, the interface has moved to a section that displays recently opened apps and additional options related to notifications and default apps, as seen in the current screen. \n\nThis action is relevant to the user request, as it opens the menu where the user can access settings for notifications. However, to complete the request of toggling the lock screen notification display, additional navigation within this section is needed. Specifically, the user will need to access the \"Notifications\" option to customize how notifications are shown on the lock screen. \n\nThus, while this action brings the user closer to their goal, more steps are required to directly modify the lock screen notification settings."
