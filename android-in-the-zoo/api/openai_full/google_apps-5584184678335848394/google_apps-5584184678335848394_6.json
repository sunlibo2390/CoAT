The \"Recently Sent\" section lists notifications from apps like Clock, Maps, and Google Play Store, with toggles to enable or disable them. Below, there's an option to view notifications from the last 7 days. The \"Lock Screen\" section controls notifications shown on the lock screen, and the \"Advanced\" section provides additional settings for notification snoozing and suggested actions.",
    "action_think": "The user has requested to toggle the setting for showing notifications on the lock screen. The current screen shows the 'Notifications' settings where an option for 'Notifications on lockscreen' is visible. This is most likely the setting that needs to be interacted with to fulfill the user request. Since 'Notifications on lockscreen' is not a toggle itself but a menu option that probably leads to a submenu where the user can toggle the display of notifications on the lock screen, the next step should be to access this menu.",

    "action_desc": "click on the 'Notifications on lockscreen' option located under the LOCK SCREEN section.",
    "action_result": "By clicking on the \"Notifications on lockscreen\" toggle, a pop-up menu has appeared with three options: \"Show alerting and silent notifications,\" \"Show alerting notifications only,\" and \"Don't show notifications.\" The current selection is \"Show alerting and silent notifications,\" which aligns with the user's request to toggle show notifications on the lock screen. This action has made progress towards completing the user's request since it brings up the options necessary to adjust the notification settings for the lock screen. To fully complete the request, the user would now need to confirm the desired setting by tapping on it, if not already selected, and then press 'Cancel' if no changes are needed or 'Done' if this interface supports such an option to save the setting."
