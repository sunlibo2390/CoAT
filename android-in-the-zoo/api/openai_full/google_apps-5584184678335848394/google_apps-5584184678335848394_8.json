Next to each app, there's a toggle switch to enable or disable notifications. There's also an option to see all notifications from the last 7 days. Below that, there's a section for \"Lock Screen\" settings that allows the user to manage how notifications appear on the lock screen. The \"Advanced\" section is collapsed, suggesting additional settings are available.",

From the screenshot and the screen description provided, it seems that the user has already made some changes to the lock screen notification settings by selecting 'Show alerting notifications only'. However, since the task is to toggle the visibility of notifications, the action that needs to be taken is to tap on the 'Notifications on lockscreen' setting to change it. Based on the history actions, the setting was accessed before, but we need to confirm whether it is currently set to show notifications or not, which is not clearly mentioned. The user's request suggests they want to change the current state of this setting\u2014either enabling it if it's currently disabled or disabling it if it's currently enabled.",
