This view displays a list of past search queries made by the user, which include requests for news videos, wallpapers, Reddit posts, information about nearby stores and directions, as well as flight searches and questions about the moon's size. Each query is preceded by a clock icon, suggesting these are recent searches or possibly saved or frequently searched items. There are icons at the top for the Google Assistant and a microphone for voice search, as well as a search bar waiting for input.",

Since the user has already opened the Google Search bar and clicked on the delete icon to clear the query, the next step should be to enter the query 'What is the speed of sound?' into the search bar and initiate the search. This will provide the user with the desired information about the speed of sound.",

The next step would likely involve you speaking the question, \"What is the speed of sound?\" This action helps move towards the user request by making the process of submitting the query easier, as it eliminates the need to type."
