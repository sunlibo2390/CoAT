To perform an uninstall action, we need to be on the app's page where the 'Uninstall' option is present, which typically replaces the 'Install' button once the app is installed. It seems there is a misunderstanding as we cannot uninstall an app that isn't installed. However, to verify whether the app is installed on the device, I would check the user's app drawer or settings.",
