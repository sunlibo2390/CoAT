This change is visible in the transition from the app-specific page (for \"ZOOM Cloud Meetings\") in the last screenshot to the search input field in the current screenshot that says \"Search for apps & games.\"\n\nHowever, this action has not made progress towards the user request to uninstall \"DoorDash - Food Delivery\" because rather than taking an action to uninstall the application, it has navigated to a search interface, which is not the correct direction for uninstalling an app. The user should instead navigate to the \"DoorDash\" app page within their device settings or within the Google Play Store and then select the option to uninstall."
