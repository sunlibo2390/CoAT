Some apps display their names clearly, like Gmail and YouTube, while others are represented by their icons.

The next logical step is to open the Chrome app in order to access its settings and then navigate to the site settings where the pop-up permissions can be modified. The previous action was to scroll up, which indicates that we were possibly searching for the Chrome app which is now in view.",

However, the action needed to access the settings menu was not yet performed. The next steps would be to open a new tab or an existing one to then access the Chrome menu and navigate to the settings to turn off pop-ups."
