There is an overlay prompt asking to sign into Chrome, but we need to access the site settings to change the pop-up blocker settings. First, the sign-in prompt needs to be dismissed by tapping on the 'X' icon on the prompt. After that, I should locate and navigate to either 'Site settings' or 'Content settings' where the pop-up blocker option would typically be found. Since 'Site settings' or 'Content settings' are not visible on the current screen, I will likely need to select the 'Advanced' option to reveal more settings where these options might be located.",
