This menu allows users to manage permissions and settings for cookies, location, camera, microphone, notifications, JavaScript, pop-ups and redirects, and ads for websites they visit.

The 'Site settings' menu is already open, and we can see the 'Pop-ups and redirects' setting, which is currently set to 'Blocked'.

On this screen, you can toggle the setting to block pop-ups and redirects, which directly impacts your request to turn off pop-ups in Chrome.\n\nThis action has brought you closer to completing the request, but the next step would be to enable the option to block pop-ups, which currently appears to be turned off (as indicated by the toggle being in the off position). Once you toggle it on, pop-ups will be blocked, achieving your goal."
