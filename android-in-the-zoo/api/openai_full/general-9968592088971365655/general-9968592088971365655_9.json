The dialog box with the options \"Google Play Store\" and \"Chrome\" is still open, and it does not appear that the selection has led to any changes on the screen.\n\nThis action has not progressed towards the user request to play the latest video from the BBC because selecting \"Google Play Store\" would typically be used to download or manage applications, not for directly playing a video. To play the video, the user would need to select \"Chrome\" to continue with the web browser or a dedicated video player app that can access and play the content from the BBC."
