Afterward, a search was made within the app using the same name as the app itself, which seems to be a mistake. The user request is to open the app and go to the login screen. Since the app is already open, the task is now to navigate to the login screen. However, the current screen shows that the content hasn't loaded or is empty, which may be because of a connectivity issue or a glitch within the app. The first step should be to try to refresh the app's content or navigate out of the potential search result that might be causing the display issue.",
