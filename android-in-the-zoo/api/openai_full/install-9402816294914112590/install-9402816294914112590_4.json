Now, in the current screenshot, the search bar is ready for input, and the system is showing recent search results, including \"HBO Max: Stream TV & Movies.\" The next step will be typing \"NewsBreak\" in the search field to locate the app.\n\nThis action is a step towards the user request, but it has not fully completed it yet. I still need to search for and either open or install the \"NewsBreak\" app."
