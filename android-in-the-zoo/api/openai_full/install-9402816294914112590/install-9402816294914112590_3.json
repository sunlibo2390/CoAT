The time at the top shows it's 3:08, and various app icons are present, such as Calendar, Camera, Chrome, Clock, Contacts, Drive, Duolingo, eBay, and others. Icons at the bottom suggest the Zoom app is on another page or folder, and there are navigation buttons for back, home, and recent apps at the very bottom.",

As the user request is to open the app and go to the login screen, the next reasonable step is to click on the 'NewsBreak' app again assuming it did not open previously. If the app is not installed, the next step would be to find it in the Play Store, but since the icon is visible, it suggests that the app is already installed.",
