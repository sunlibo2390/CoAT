An item for Microsoft 365 is being advertised for $69.99 per year, with an \"Add to Cart\" button adjacent to the description. The total of the cart is displayed as $2,021.71, with options to pick up the items at El Camino Real store or get free shipping to a specific zip code. The checkout process can be initiated by tapping the yellow 'Checkout' button. There is also a promotion for Best Buy's Total Tech membership offering savings on AppleCare+.",
    "action_think": "To clear all items from the cart, I need to find a way to remove or edit the items within the cart. The screenshot does not show any direct option to edit or remove items. Usually, cart pages have an edit button or a way to remove items directly from the cart summary. I will have to look for such an option by either scrolling down or looking for an edit button. After clearing the cart, the next steps would be to search for the 'Bose SoundLink Mini' on BestBuy, add it to the cart, and then proceed to checkout.",

This action has not directly cleared items from the cart nor added the Bose SoundLink Mini to the cart. However, this is a necessary step to reach the 'Remove' option associated with each item in the cart to clear the cart, as per the user's initial part of the request. The next steps should include selecting 'Remove' for each item to clear the cart and then adding the Bose SoundLink Mini to the cart before proceeding to checkout."
