As this task involves using a browser to navigate to the Best Buy website, perform actions on the website, and proceed with a checkout, the user must open a web browser. Google Chrome is accessible from the home screen, which will allow them to navigate to the Best Buy website. There is no direct way to interact with the Best Buy cart without first opening a web browser and going to their website. Therefore, the next step is to open Google Chrome.",

The landing page shows a search that has been made for \"apple airpods pro,\" and it displays products related to this search. This action has made progress towards the user request in the sense that the browser is necessary to navigate the Best Buy website. However, it has not directly addressed the user's request to clear items from the cart and add the Bose SoundLink Mini to the cart. The next steps required would be to navigate to the cart, remove the existing items, search for the Bose SoundLink Mini, add it to the cart, and then proceed to checkout."
