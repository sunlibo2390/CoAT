Since I am currently viewing the search results for 'apple airpods pro', I need to navigate to the cart to clear the current items. The cart icon is visible in the screenshot with a number '2' indicating there are items in it. This is where I should start to clear the cart.",

This switch is visible because the URL has changed from bestbuy.com/site/searchpage to bestbuy.com/cart, and the screen now displays the contents of the shopping cart with a total amount of $2,021.71.\n\nThe current action has made progress towards the user request by allowing access to the cart where items can be cleared, which is a necessary step before adding the Bose SoundLink Mini. The next steps would involve removing all the items currently in the cart to ensure that only the Bose SoundLink Mini is in the cart before proceeding to checkout, which is in alignment with the user request."
