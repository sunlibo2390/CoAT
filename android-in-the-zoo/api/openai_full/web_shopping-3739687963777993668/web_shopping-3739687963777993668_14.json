The first part of clearing all items from the cart seems to have been accomplished based on the notification at the top saying 'We've removed this item from your cart.' This indicates that the user may have already removed the items from their cart, and no other items are visible on this screen. The second part of the request is to add a Bose SoundLink Mini to the cart and then proceed to checkout. To add the Bose SoundLink Mini to the cart, I need to search for the product within the Best Buy app. The 'Search' bar is visible on the top of the screen. My next action should be to tap on the 'Search' bar and enter the product's name.",
