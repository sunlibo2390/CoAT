There is one item visible in the cart, a MacBook Pro 14\" laptop with an Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB memory, and a 512GB SSD, priced at $1,599.00. The screenshot indicates that an item has been removed from the cart, with the options to \"Undo\" or \"Save\" that action. Additionally, there is a pickup option available at El Camino Real with the possibility of free shipping to a specified ZIP code. A \"Checkout\" button is present for completing the purchase.",

The current cart shows that the AirPods Pro have already been removed. Now, the user needs to clear the MacBook Pro from the cart, add the requested item, and then proceed to checkout.",

    "action_result": "By scrolling up, the screen now displays additional item details and options for the MacBook Pro 14\" laptop in the user's cart. The action revealed options such as 'Save for later' and 'Remove', which are pertinent to the user's request to clear all items from the cart.\n\nWe see an option 'Remove' under the item's quantity selector, which can be used to remove the MacBook Pro from the cart. To fulfill the user's request, the 'Remove' button should be clicked for each item in the cart. Since the user also wants to add a Bose SoundLink Mini to the cart and proceed to checkout, the next step after removing all current items would be to search for the Bose SoundLink Mini and add it to the cart before proceeding.\n\nThis action has made some progress towards the user request, as it reveals the necessary controls to clear the items, but further actions are needed to complete the request."
