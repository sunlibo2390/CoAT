There is an empty search bar with the placeholder text \"Search for anything,\" alongside a blue search button with a magnifying glass icon, indicating that a user can search for items on the eBay platform.

The current action has placed the cursor in the search bar, but the task at hand requires dealing with the shopping cart rather than searching for a new item. First, I should check if there are items in the cart that need to be removed. Since the page appears to be the cart but is incomplete or not fully loaded, the next step should be to reload the page or wait for it to load properly to see the cart's contents.
