Since the eBay homepage is currently open, the next step is to navigate to the shopping cart to check its contents and proceed to empty it if necessary. The shopping cart icon is typically represented as a cart or bag and is often located in the top right corner of the screen. In this screenshot, we can see icons at the top section of the eBay homepage. One of these icons may be the shopping cart. The next single-step action should be to identify and click on that shopping cart icon to view its contents.",

Next, to continue fulfilling the user request, I would need to search for \"macbook pro 15 inch\" on eBay. To do this, I would navigate back to the eBay homepage or the search bar to enter the product search query."
