The user has typed \"adobe acrobat\" into the search bar, indicating that they are searching for the Adobe Acrobat app or related apps. The interface includes a back arrow on the top left, suggesting that the user can return to the previous screen, and a microphone icon on the top right for voice search.

However, the current screen shows a search for 'adobe acrobat' in an app store, which is unrelated to the user's request. Since 'Nova Launcher' is a separate app, I need to navigate to the homepage or app drawer to locate it or search for it in this app store if it's not installed. I do not see a direct indicator on the screen that 'Nova Launcher' is already installed, so the next step should be to search for it in the app store. However, to do this, I need to clear the current search input and type 'Nova Launcher' instead.",

The search results show the Nova Launcher app, along with related search suggestions, such as \"Nova Launcher Pro\" and \"Nova Launcher themes.\"\n\nThis action has made progress towards the user's request, as it has helped locate the Nova Launcher app. The next step would be to either install or open the app, depending on whether it's already installed on the device."
