This is evident from the current screenshot which shows options such as \"Follow system,\" \"Light,\" and \"Dark\" for theme settings and \"Dark theme color\" selection, as well as icon customization options.\n\nThis action has made progress towards the user's request to open the \"Nova Launcher\" app. However, it does not directly address the second part of the user's request, which is to enter a username and password. To fulfill the user's request, the next step would require navigating to the specific section within the app where login credentials can be entered, if available. As the current screenshot does not display a login interface, additional steps would be necessary to locate and access the login area."
