Since the current screenshot displays the Adobe Acrobat Reader app page on the Google Play Store, I must navigate to the home screen or app drawer to locate the 'Nova Launcher' app, or search for it on the Play Store if it's not installed. I should first press the home button to exit the Google Play Store and find the 'Nova Launcher' app.",

In the last screenshot, the app \"Adobe Acrobat Reader\" is displayed in the search results, showing that the search feature is functional.\n\nHowever, this action does not directly progress towards completing the user request of opening the \"Nova Launcher\" app. Since the current screen is showing results for \"Adobe Acrobat\" and not the \"Nova Launcher\" app, it seems the search query hasn't been entered yet, or the app has not been found.\n\nTo complete the user request, the next steps would be:\n1. Typing \"Nova Launcher\" in the search bar.\n2. Ensuring that the app is installed, and if not, proceeding to install it.\n3. Opening the app and entering the provided username and password.\n\nSo, while the search icon click is a necessary step, additional actions like entering the app name and installing it (if not already installed) are still required to fulfill the user request."
