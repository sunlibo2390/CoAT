Below that, options for shopping methods such as \"Picking up,\" \"Same Day Delivery,\" and \"Shipping\" are available. Further down, there are \"Popular Filters\" to further refine the search, including brand filters like \"Heyday,\" \"Usb type-c cables,\" and other filter options such as \"Category,\" \"Deals,\" \"Price,\" and \"Sold by.\" At the bottom, it indicates there are 941 results for \"usb-c.\"",
    "action_think": "The current screen shows search results for 'usb-c' products on the Target website but does not display the actual shopping cart. The screenshot shows various filters and shopping options, but no direct link to the shopping cart. To clear the shopping cart and then add an item, I would need to navigate to the shopping cart itself. The shopping cart icon is typically represented by a cart-shaped symbol which is not visible in the provided screenshot. Since the navigation menu (hamburger icon) is usually where the shopping cart can be accessed on mobile websites, the next logical step is to open it.",

The visible product now shows the \"Insten 18W 2-Port Fast Charger\" that could potentially be added to the cart. However, this action has not yet directly contributed to clearing the shopping cart or adding a \"usb-c\" item to the cart as per the user\u2019s request. To make progress toward completing the request, you will need to perform additional actions such as selecting the product and adding it to the cart, while also ensuring the cart is cleared first if necessary."
