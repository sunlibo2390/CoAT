The site is promoting their service where customers can get top gifts with free pickup or have them delivered by a service called Shipt. There's a highlighted message saying \"There's still time!\" and \"Finish your gift list\" accompanied by a visual of wrapped gift packages, suggesting urgency in completing holiday shopping. Customers are encouraged to explore gift ideas through a link provided. The website interface includes a search bar, navigation menu, and a shopping cart icon, indicating that users can browse and shop for items directly from their mobile device.",

On the current screen, I can see the shopping cart icon at the top right corner of the Target website interface. I should click on this icon to view the cart. After accessing the cart, I can then proceed to remove items if there are any. Once the cart is empty, the next part of the user request involves adding a 'usb-c' item to the cart, which will require searching for 'usb-c' on the website, selecting an appropriate item, and adding it to the cart.",

This action has made progress towards the user request because typing a query such as \"usb-c\" into the search bar is necessary to find and select the desired item to add to the shopping cart. However, it is also important to first clear the shopping cart, as per the user request, which has not been addressed by this action. The next step should be to navigate to the shopping cart to remove any existing items before adding a new item."
