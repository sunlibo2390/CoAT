Since the user has already searched for 'target', the direct link to the shopping cart page on Target's website ('Cart : Target') is visible in the search results. To proceed with the user\u2019s request, the next logical step is to go to the cart page where items can be removed and then new items can be added.

This is an essential step towards completing the user's request because it is necessary to be on the Target website in order to clear the shopping cart and add an item, in this case a \"usb-c\" product, to the cart. The current screen now displays the target.com homepage, from which I can proceed to find and manipulate the shopping cart."
