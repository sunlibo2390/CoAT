The first step will be to navigate to the Target website. We can do this by entering the website address into the search bar.

This has brought up a list that includes \"walmart.com,\" which could be a result of prior visits or searches related to shopping. However, this does not directly progress towards clearing the shopping cart on Target or adding \"usb-c\" to the cart on Target, as the user's intention was not to navigate to Walmart's website but to Target's. To proceed with the user's request, the next step would be to either type \"Target.com\" into the search bar or navigate to the Target website if it's listed in the browsing history, and then proceed with the shopping cart management."
