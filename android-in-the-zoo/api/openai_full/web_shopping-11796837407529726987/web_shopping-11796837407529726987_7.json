The current screen is showing trending searches, which indicates that we have to navigate to the shopping cart function on the Target website. There is no direct access to the shopping cart from this screen. My logical next step would involve navigating away from the 'Trending searches' section towards the shopping cart, which might be accessible from the main menu or possibly indicated by an icon usually associated with a cart or basket. To find the shopping cart, I might look for a cart icon, accessible either from the top of the page or from a main menu that could be represented by a set of lines or dots, often referred to as a 'hamburger' menu.",
