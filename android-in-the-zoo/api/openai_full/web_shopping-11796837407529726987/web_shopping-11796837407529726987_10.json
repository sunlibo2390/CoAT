Currently, we are on the search results page for 'usb-c' items. The screenshot shows a specific product, the 'Insten 18W 2-Port Fast Charger.' To proceed, the next step is to navigate to the shopping cart to check its contents and clear it if necessary. We have no current access to or visibility of the shopping cart icon on this screen, which would typically be symbolized by a cart or bag icon. Typically, the cart icon is located in the top-right corner of the screen in shopping apps. The user's shopping cart needs to be cleared before adding new items to it, as per the user's request. The screenshot's focus on the product suggests we may first need to navigate away from this view to access the shopping cart.",
