It provides a link to Pinterest's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, and mentions that the user can manage Sign in with Google in their Google Account.

The user request is to open the Pinterest app, go to the login, and select the 'forgot password' option. Since the 'forgot password' option is usually found on a login screen where users are asked to enter their credentials manually, the next step is to look for a way to navigate to the manual login screen where such an option would typically be available. The currently displayed dialogue for signing in with Google does not seem to include a 'forgot password' link directly, so it is necessary to dismiss this dialogue if there is no visible option behind it and look for the sign-in screen that asks for a username and password.",
