It explains how the \"Sign in with Google\" feature works, emphasizing ease, security, and control over shared information. The screen highlights that only your name, email, and profile image are shared. The user is prompted to click \"Continue\" to proceed.",
    "action_think": "Based on the current screenshot, it appears that the 'Pinterest' app has been opened, and the user is now faced with a 'Google Account' sign-in prompt, which is a common method to log in to various apps including Pinterest. As per the user's request to go to login and select 'forgot password', the user likely needs to navigate past this screen to reach Pinterest's login page where they can find the option for 'forgot password'. The 'Continue' button seems to be part of the Google sign-in process, however, it is not necessarily the correct step if the user intends to reset their password and may not be using a Google account to log in. The next step should be to look for the 'forgot password' link on the actual Pinterest login page, or to exit this screen if it doesn't lead to the specific Pinterest login that would allow the user to reset their password.",

        "Find and click on the 'forgot password' option within the login screen."

    "action_result": "By clicking on the \"Continue\" button on the previous screen, the action has moved the process forward to a screen where it is prompting to continue with the Google account indicated. This screen is a part of the Google account sign-in process for the Pinterest app.\n\nWe see an account with the name \"Sarah Brennan\" ready to be used to log into Pinterest, indicating that the previous action has pre-filled the Google account information to streamline the sign-in process. However, this does not directly progress towards the user's request to select the \"forgot password\" option because it's currently attempting to sign in rather than address a forgotten password.\n\nTo proceed with the user's request from this current screen, you would need to avoid signing in with the presented Google account, look for a \"forgot password\" link or option, and initiate the password recovery process for Pinterest instead. If the option is not visible, it might be necessary to first select an option like \"Sign in with email\" or simply \"Sign in\" to reach a screen where the \"forgot password\" link is available."
