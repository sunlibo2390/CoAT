The next logical step is to check if the app is already installed or if it needs to be installed from the Play Store. The current screen shows the Play Store and highlights HBO Max. To fulfill the user request, I need to search for 'Pinterest' in the search bar and check if it appears. If it is not installed, I will install it.

This action does move us closer to the user\u2019s goal, as it enables searching for the app, but it is not yet fully completed."
