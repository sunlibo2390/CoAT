The main screen area features app icons for Roku, Upside, Zoom, Chat, and Expedia. Below them, there is a dock with five more app icons including the Phone, Messages, Google Play, Chrome, and Camera.

The provided screenshot shows the home screen with various app icons, but Spotify is not visible among them. To move forward, we need to check if the app is installed on the device, which means we need to view all apps.

The action has made progress towards the user's request by bringing up the full list of apps where Spotify could potentially be found if it were installed. To continue working towards completing the user's request, I would need to search for the Spotify app within the app drawer, and if not found, proceed to the Google Play Store to install it."
