The current screenshot displays a product page on Amazon, most likely the Bose SoundLink Mini based on the previous actions, where two main options 'Add to Cart' and 'Buy Now' are visible.

This is a direct consequence of the last action and indicates that the item has been successfully placed in the cart. The current screen now offers the option to \"Proceed to checkout,\" which aligns with the next step of the user's request to select checkout. This action has definitively made progress towards completing the user's request."
