This action allows the user to review the items in the cart, including the Dell XPS 17 laptop, which is currently the only item in the cart. \n\nHowever, this action does not directly clear the cart or add the \"Razer Blade\" to it. To proceed with the user's request, the next steps would be to remove the Dell XPS 17 laptop from the cart, add the \"Razer Blade\" laptop, and then proceed to checkout. \n\nSo, while this action has brought the user to the cart page, further actions are needed to complete the request."
