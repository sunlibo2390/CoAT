Below that notification is a section titled \"Featured items you may like\" with three products displayed: a Logitech MK345 wireless combo, Amazon Basics wireless computer keyboard, and Logitech C Pro webcam, each with their prices, customer ratings, and options to see additional buying options or add to cart. There is a button at the bottom labeled \"Continue shopping,\" and navigation controls suggest the user can scroll further or jump to the top of the page.",
    "action_think": "According to the screenshot and screen description, the Dell XPS 17 9720 Laptop was removed from the shopping cart, but there's no indication whether the cart is now empty. Since the user requested to clear the cart and then add 'razer blade' to the cart, the next step is to verify if the cart is empty. There is no 'cart' icon visible on this screen, but there is a mention of the cart at the top right corner of the address bar. It's likely that clicking on this cart notification or icon will take us to the cart to confirm its status. After confirming the cart is empty, the next action would be to search for 'razer blade' and add it to the cart, followed by proceeding to checkout.",

This is a necessary step toward adding a Razer Blade product to your cart, as the search results now show relevant options, such as \"Razer Blade 15,\" \"Razer Blade 14,\" and others. However, this action has not yet added any item to the cart, and the cart still remains empty (indicated by the cart icon showing 0 items).\n\nThis action partially advances the user request, as it moves closer to the goal of adding a \"razer blade\" product to the cart. The next step would be to select a specific item from the search results and then add it to the cart before proceeding with checkout. Therefore, the task is not yet completed."
