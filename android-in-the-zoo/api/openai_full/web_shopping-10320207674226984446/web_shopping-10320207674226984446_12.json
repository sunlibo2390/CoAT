Users can change the view of the products at the top. Below that, there are options to sort items by relevance, price, and rating, with \"Top Rated\" currently selected. The \"FILTER BY\" section suggests that more options like \"COLLECTIONS\" and \"TYPE\" can be expanded to narrow down the search results. At the bottom, there are buttons to clear all filters or apply the selected filters to the search.",

The current screenshot shows that the 'Top Rated' option under 'SORT BY' has already been selected, which corresponds to the user's request. The next step would be to apply this sorting criterion to see the list of table lamps sorted by the top ratings on the Crate and Barrel website.",

As shown in the current screenshot, the page has been refreshed, and it seems that the search results for 'Table Lamp' are now sorted by the user's preference. This action has made progress towards completing the user's request to check the best-rated table lamp on Crate and Barrel, assuming the sorting has been correctly set to display top-rated items first. However, the current screenshot does not explicitly show that the 'Top Rated' filter has been applied in the search results\u2014further confirmation or scrolling through the search results would be needed to ensure that the best-rated lamps are indeed being displayed."
