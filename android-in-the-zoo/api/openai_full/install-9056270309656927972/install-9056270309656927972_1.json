However, based on the user request to install the \"Messages\" app, this action alone does not directly progress toward completing the request. To install the app, you would typically need to access the App Store or search for the app, which requires further navigation or interactions beyond just scrolling. Therefore, while this action may help expose more content, it does not move us closer to installing the \"Messages\" app."
