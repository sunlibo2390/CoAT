The user's request is to search for hotels in London, which implies that they need to see a list of available hotels in the city, with the ability to view details, prices, and potentially book a room. The next step should be to close the pop-up to return to the main content of the website where the user can continue their search for hotels. By closing the pop-up, we decide if we're on the right page to execute the search and if not navigate to the appropriate section or perform a new search on the website.",

As a result, the user can now view the full content of the app or webpage without any obstructions. This action helps move towards the user request of searching for hotels in London, as the pop-up was likely blocking or distracting from the search functionality. With the ad gone, the user can now proceed to use the search bar or other options on the screen to search for hotels. Therefore, this action contributes positively towards completing the user\u2019s request."
