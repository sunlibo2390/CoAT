The previous actions indicate that the user used Google Search to find a hotel booking site and clicked on an advertisement to reach this page. It seems that the website is set to search for London Hotels by default, as seen on-screen. To complete the request, the user now needs to input the check-in and check-out dates and proceed with the search. However, these fields are not entirely visible on-screen but are indicated below the location search bar. The next logical step is to tap on the 'Check in \u00b7 Check out' field to input the dates.",

This action is a step towards completing the user request, as it is necessary to input check-in and check-out dates, as well as the number of guests, to perform a detailed search for hotels in London on this website."
