Below the button, the website claims to be \"Trusted by thousands of travellers\" and indicates that over \"50,000+ rooms booked every month\".

Considering the history actions and the current screenshot, the user has navigated through a mobile browser to LateRooms.com and is currently at a section of the site where they can initiate a hotel search. In the screenshot, we can see a prominent 'SEARCH' button at the top of the screen. It is likely that clicking on this button will allow the user to enter search criteria for hotels in London. Since this is aligned with the user's request, the next logical step would be to click on this 'SEARCH' button to proceed with the search for hotels in London.",
