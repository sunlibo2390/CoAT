However, since the current screenshot shows the Google search results page, the first step is to navigate to the eBay website. By tapping on the top link in the search results (the official eBay website link), I will be able to access eBay, where I can then proceed with the specific requests of managing the shopping cart and searching for items.

Comparing the last screenshot with the current one, it is visible that the eBay homepage has loaded, and I am now within the eBay platform where I can perform specific actions related to shopping, such as adding items to the cart or checking out.\n\nThis action has made progress towards the user's request by bringing us to the place where we can search for the specified item, 'Duracell triple A batteries'. The next steps would include using the eBay search bar to look for the batteries, selecting the first entry as per user instructions, adding it to the cart, and proceeding to checkout. However, the user's initial request also mentions emptying the shopping cart, which should be addressed before adding new items. The current screen does not show the shopping cart, so we would need to navigate to the cart to first empty it before proceeding with the user's request to search for the item and add it to the cart."
