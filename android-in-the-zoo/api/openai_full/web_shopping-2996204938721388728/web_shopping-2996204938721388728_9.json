A notification at the top indicates that an item (Apple AirPods 3rd Generation Wireless Charging Case) was removed from the cart. The main message on the page states that the shopping cart is empty and prompts the user to sign in to see their items. There are two main call-to-action buttons: \"Sign in\" and \"Start shopping\".

The next step in the user request is to search for 'duracell triple a' batteries on eBay.com. To do this, I would need to navigate to the search bar at the top of the eBay page.

The last screenshot shows an empty shopping cart on eBay, while the current screenshot shows the eBay search bar, indicating that I have successfully navigated to a place where I can enter search terms.\n\nThis action has made progress towards the user's request. The next steps would include typing \"Duracell Triple A\" into the search bar, selecting the first search result, adding it to the cart, and proceeding to checkout. However, please note that since the shopping cart was already empty in the last screenshot, the task of emptying the shopping cart had already been completed before the current action took place."
