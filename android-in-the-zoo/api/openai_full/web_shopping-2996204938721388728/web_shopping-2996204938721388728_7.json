To fulfil the user request, I need to continue by removing the remaining items from the shopping cart before proceeding with the new search for 'duracell triple a' batteries on eBay.

This is evident from the notification at the top of the current screenshot, and also by the updated cart details which now only show the Apple AirPods 3rd Generation Wireless as the remaining item. This action has progressed the user request as it was necessary to empty the shopping cart before searching for a new item on eBay.com. The cart still contains one item, so further action is needed to complete the user request of emptying the cart. Once the cart is empty, the next step would be to search for \"duracell triple a\" on eBay.com."
