The next logical step should be to initiate the search to retrieve the weather information for Beijing. Since the user's request is to find out what the weather is like in Beijing, carrying out the search will provide the user with the requested information. Therefore, the next action is to execute the search by either pressing enter on the virtual keyboard or clicking on the search button, neither of which is visible in the screenshot. Assuming the virtual keyboard is open but hidden in the screenshot, our next outlined action will be based on standard mobile interactions.",

To complete the user's request, typing the query about Beijing's weather into the search bar and performing the search would be the necessary next step."
