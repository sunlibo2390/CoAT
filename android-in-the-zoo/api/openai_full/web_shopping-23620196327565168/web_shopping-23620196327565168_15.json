Currently, the screen shows a product page for a USB C OTG cable. To proceed, I should navigate to the shopping cart by finding and tapping on the cart icon which is typically located either at the top of the screen or within a menu.

However, it does not fulfill the full request to clear the shopping cart on eBay, search for \"usb-a,\" select the first entry, and then add that item to the cart.\n\nTo proceed, you would need to clear the current cart if it contains any other items, follow the search request for \"usb-a,\" select the first entry as per the instruction, and add that particular item to the cart."
