To clear the shopping cart, we would need to navigate to the cart page on eBay, not the product details page. However, the action aligns with the second part of the user's request, which involves searching for a \"usb-a\" item, selecting the first entry, and adding it to the cart. The screenshot indicates that the item the user inquired about (\"On The Go USB Host Adapter Cable USB Type C to USB A Female OTG Cable\") can now be added to the cart by selecting the \"Add to cart\" option. \n\nTo proceed with the user's request, the next steps would be to add this item to the shopping cart and then navigate to the shopping cart to clear it as per the initial request."
