However, this action has not directly progressed towards the user request of clearing the shopping cart on eBay. \n\nTo progress towards the user's request, we need to navigate to the shopping cart, which can typically be done by selecting the cart icon, which does not appear to be visible in the current screenshot. Therefore, the next step would be to find and select the cart icon or navigate to the appropriate section within the app where the shopping cart can be managed."
