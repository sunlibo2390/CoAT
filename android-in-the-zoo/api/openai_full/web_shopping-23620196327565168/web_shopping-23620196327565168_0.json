Both screenshots show the home screen of the phone at the same time with the same wallpaper and icons. The current screenshot now shows an options menu with \"Home settings,\" \"Widgets,\" and \"Wallpapers.\"\n\nSince the user's request was to clear the shopping cart on eBay, search for \"usb-a\" on eBay, select the first entry, and add it to the cart, the action of scrolling up on the home screen has not made progress towards completing the user's request. The appropriate next step would be to locate and open the eBay application or use a web browser to navigate to the eBay website to carry out the user's request."
