Below are four results from a previous search or suggestion: Etsy, Amazon, AliExpress, and IKEA, each with accompanying logos and a button to navigate to the result. There's also a \"Manage history\" option below the search results. At the bottom are icons for common Google apps: Photos, Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Drive. The navigation bar at the very bottom indicates this is a recent version of Android with gesture navigation enabled.",

Although 'Walmart' has not been previously searched for, it\u2019s possible to type in the new search query directly into the Google search bar at the top of the screen to find the desired product on Walmart's website. Since there is no direct access to Walmart from the current apps shown, using the search bar to navigate to Walmart's website is a reasonable next step.",

This is a step towards completing the user's request because it indicates that a search query is being initiated. However, to specifically find the best rated 4K TV on Walmart, the search needs to be refined further to include terms such as \"best rated 4K TV.\" This action aligns with the direction of the user's request but requires additional input to provide the desired results."
