Below the search bar, there is a list of suggested search queries related to Walmart, such as \"walmart mountain view,\" \"walmart near me,\" \"walmart san jose,\" \"walmart hours,\" and several more. These suggestions are likely based on popular searches or the user's location and search history. The user can tap on any of these suggestions to conduct a quick search on that topic.",

Since the current screen already has 'walmart' typed into the Google Search app, it would be reasonable to refine this search query to be more specific to the user's request. We can do this by adding terms related to 'best rated 4K TV' to the existing search query.",

    "action_result": "By clicking on the Walmart search suggestion, the results are now focused on Walmart's official site, showing the Walmart homepage with a highlighted advertisement for online shopping and ratings. This action has directed the user towards Walmart's online store, which could help them search for products, such as a 4K TV.\n\nHowever, it has not yet led directly to a 4K TV search or its best-rated options. To fully meet the user's request, the next step should be to search specifically for \"4K TV\" within Walmart's website, which will show a list of TVs and allow the user to sort or filter by ratings. Therefore, while this action moves towards the goal, further search refinement is needed to achieve the exact result of showing the best-rated 4K TV."
