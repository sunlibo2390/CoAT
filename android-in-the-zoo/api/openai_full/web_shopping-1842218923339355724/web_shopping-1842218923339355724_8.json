At the top, there is a search bar where users can type in queries to search for items available at Walmart. Below the search bar, there is a list of previously searched terms such as \"best rated 4k tvs,\" \"cheap bikes,\" \"shimano brake pads,\" and \"nintendo switch,\" each with an 'x' icon that likely allows users to remove these terms from their search history. There is also a 'Cancel' button next to the search bar, indicating the user could cancel the search or clear the input field.",
    "action_think": "The current screenshot shows the search function within the Walmart website, and a list of previously searched terms is displayed. The search bar is empty, so the next logical step would be to type in a relevant search query to find the best rated 4K TVs on Walmart. Selecting one of the previously searched items would not be appropriate as none of them directly match the request. Therefore, the next action should be to initiate a search for 'best rated 4k tvs'.",

    "action_result": "By clicking on the search suggestion \"best rated 4k tvs,\" you have navigated to a search results page specifically showing 4K TVs with high ratings. This action directly moves you closer to your goal of finding the best-rated 4K TVs on Walmart. However, it seems you may need to refine or filter the results to ensure they are exclusive to Walmart or further tailored to your preferences."
