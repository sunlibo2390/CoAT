There are two buttons available: \"Uninstall\" and \"Open,\" suggesting that the app is already installed on the device. Below the app name and developer, there is a section titled \"What's new,\" mentioning the latest update was on August 23, 2022, which includes bug fixes and performance enhancements. Users can also \"Rate this app\" with a star rating system, and there's an option to \"Write a review.\" Lastly, there's a \"Developer contact\" section that can be expanded for more information.",
    "action_think": "The current screen shows the Google Play Store page for 'Locket Widget,' which is unrelated to the user's request. The task requires opening the 'DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser' app. Since this app is not currently open or visible, I will need to check if it is installed. If not, it needs to be installed first. The first step is to search for the 'DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser' on the Google Play Store and install it if needed.",

This has allowed the \"Search for apps & games\" input field to become active, where one can type in the name of an app they wish to find. The search history below the search bar indicates that \"walmart\" was previously searched for.\n\nThis action has made partial progress towards the user request. To complete the user request, I need to search for \"DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser\" in the search bar to either open it (if it is already installed) or to install it (if it is not currently installed). Once the app is opened or installed, the next steps would be to navigate to the login section and then select the forgot password option, as the user has requested."
