The map displays a region with various points of interest, such as the Shoreline Amphitheatre, Googleplex, and Charleston Park. A blue dot indicates the user's location. At the bottom, there is a notice for upgrading Google Maps to get the latest information and COVID-19 updates, along with two buttons: one for closing the message (the 'X' button) and the other for presumably learning more or taking action to upgrade (the rectangular box). On the bottom right, there are two floating buttons: one for accessing Google Maps settings or features (the icon with layers) and the other to start navigation or explore ('GO' button).",
