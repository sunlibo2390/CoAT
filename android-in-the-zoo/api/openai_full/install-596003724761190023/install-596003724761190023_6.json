This action has helped to identify that the app is present on the device, which is a necessary step towards opening the app to follow the user's request to go to login and select \"forgot password.\"\n\nThe next step would be to tap on the \"Open\" button to launch the DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser app. Once the app is open, I can then assist further with navigating to the login screen and selecting the \"forgot password\" option."
