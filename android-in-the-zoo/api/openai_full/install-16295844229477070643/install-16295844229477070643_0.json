There's an email address that appears to be linked to these settings.

However, the user has requested to uninstall the app 'Google Maps', which is unrelated to the current screen. To proceed with the user's request, it is necessary to exit the current app settings and access the device's app management settings, typically found in the main device settings menu. Since no actions have been taken yet, the next single-step action should be to navigate back to the device's home screen or app drawer from where we can access the main settings to uninstall Google Maps.",

This action is a step towards completing the user request to uninstall \"Google Maps\" because being on the home screen allows for the next step, which is to locate the Google Play Store app where the uninstallation can be initiated. However, the direct access to app management usually resides in the phone settings or by long-pressing the app icon from the home screen or app drawer, not specifically within the Google Play Store. To proceed, the appropriate action would be to long-press the \"Google Maps\" app icon and select 'App info' or navigate through the settings to the apps section to uninstall the app."
