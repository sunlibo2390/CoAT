To uninstall an app, one needs to either find the app in the Google Play Store and use the uninstall option there or go to the device's settings and uninstall it from the applications manager. Since we're already in the Play Store, the first option seems more direct. Therefore, I need to search for 'Google Maps' in the store, reach its app page, and look for the uninstall option.",

This interface displays a text field where users can input terms to search for applications and games. It also provides a list of recent search queries below the search bar.\n\nHowever, this action has not made progress toward the user's request to uninstall \"Google Maps.\" To uninstall an app, the user does not need to use the search function in the Google Play Store. Instead, the user should navigate to the device settings, specifically the Apps or Application Manager section, to uninstall the desired application. Therefore, the next step should be to exit the Google Play Store and go to the device's settings to find \"Google Maps\" and proceed with its uninstallation."
