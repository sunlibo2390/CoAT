Two search results are visible: \"life360 find family & friends\" and \"mobile banking apps.\" At the top is a search bar inviting users to search for apps and games, indicating that these results are likely from a previous search made by the user. The interface elements suggest that the user can navigate back using the arrow on the top left corner and potentially perform other actions using icons on the top right corner.",
    "action_think": "The user has requested to uninstall 'Google Maps', but the current screen is showing a search interface, possibly in the app store. The search history and the absence of an active app screen suggest that the previous actions were related to navigating within the app store rather than interacting with the 'Google Maps' app. The next step should be to exit the current search interface and navigate back to the home screen or app drawer to locate 'Google Maps' for uninstallation.",

This displays various options related to Google Maps, including \"google maps live satellite view,\" \"google maps go,\" \"google maps street view,\" \"google maps offline,\" and \"google maps navigation.\"\n\nHowever, this action does not directly contribute to the user's request to uninstall \"Google Maps.\" To uninstall the app, the user would typically need to find the app within their device's settings or app management section rather than conducting a search within the app store. The next step should be to navigate away from the app store and go to the device's Settings to locate the \"Apps\" or \"Applications\" section where they can then select \"Google Maps\" from the list of installed apps and proceed to uninstall it."
