This action does not directly contribute to the completion of the user request to view the shopping cart or add the MacBook Air to it.\n\nTo proceed with adding the MacBook Air to the cart, the user will need to select the desired configuration and proceed to the \"Add to Cart\" button (which seems to be missing from this view). Additionally, if the user intends to check the shopping cart, they will need to navigate to the cart icon or a different section of the page. Thus, the action has not made significant progress toward the user request."}
