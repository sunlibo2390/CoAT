This action allows the user to view the contents of their cart, making progress towards the goal of showing the shopping cart. However, this action alone does not directly add the \"MacBook Air\" to the cart, as it only opens the cart view without completing the addition of the product.\n\nTo fully complete the user request, the next steps would involve searching for the \"MacBook Air\" on Amazon, selecting the desired model, and then adding it to the cart. Therefore, while the current action is a step forward, it has not yet fully completed the request."}
