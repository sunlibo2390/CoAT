The user can choose between three color options (Silver, Gold, Space Gray) and two configurations (With or Without AppleCare+). The price for the MacBook Air without AppleCare+ is $967.50, and with AppleCare+ it is $1098.00.

Since the user wants to add the 'MacBook Air' to the cart, I will need to look for an 'Add to Cart' button, which is usually located below the product details or options.

However, the direct consequence of this action is not immediately related to accessing the shopping cart or adding a MacBook Air to the cart.\n\nBased on the current screenshot, the shopping cart is still not visible, and the MacBook Air has not been added to the cart. Therefore, this action has not yet made progress towards the user request of showing the shopping cart and adding the MacBook Air. Further actions, like navigating to the shopping cart or searching for the MacBook Air and adding it to the cart, would be needed to complete the task.",

This action does not directly contribute to the completion of the user request to view the shopping cart or add the MacBook Air to it.\n\nTo proceed with adding the MacBook Air to the cart, the user will need to select the desired configuration and proceed to the \"Add to Cart\" button (which seems to be missing from this view). Additionally, if the user intends to check the shopping cart, they will need to navigate to the cart icon or a different section of the page. Thus, the action has not made significant progress toward the user request.",
