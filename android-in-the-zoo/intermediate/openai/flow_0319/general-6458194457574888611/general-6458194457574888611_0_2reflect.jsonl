However, this does not directly assist in finding the news for this evening, as the search bar is empty and requires the user to enter a query. \n\nThis action has made progress towards the user request because it has opened the app needed to search for the news. Now, the next step is for the user to type something like \"news this evening\" or \"evening news\" into the search bar to retrieve the desired information."
