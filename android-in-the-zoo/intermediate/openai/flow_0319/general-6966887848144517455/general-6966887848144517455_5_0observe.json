It mentions a 1993 photo and historical data of a trained cheetah reaching 63.7 mph (102.5 km/h), which remains the highest recorded speed for a land mammal. The page also highlights modern data from cheetahs in captivity and the wild, with GPS collars showing slower speeds, particularly during hunts. The text reflects on the question of cheetah speed and their breathtaking sprints in open grasslands."}
