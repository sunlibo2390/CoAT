However, the search results currently do not show the app itself, suggesting it may not have been found or displayed yet. Therefore, the next logical step is to tap on the app if it appears in the results, then proceed to uninstall it. \n\nIn summary, this action is part of the process, but it has not yet led directly to the completion of the user request (uninstalling the app). More action is needed to locate and uninstall the Google Translate app."}
