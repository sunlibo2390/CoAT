However, it hasn't directly contributed to the user request of uninstalling \"Google Translate\" because the current search results focus on LinkedIn, not on \"Google Translate.\"\n\nThis action has not made progress towards the user request yet.

This action has not made progress towards the user request, as it opened the Chrome app instead of leading to the necessary location to uninstall Google Translate.
