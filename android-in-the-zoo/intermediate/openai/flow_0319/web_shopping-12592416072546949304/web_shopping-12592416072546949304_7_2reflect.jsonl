This action has moved you away from the empty shopping cart screen, bringing you back to the product listing page, which is necessary to add items to the cart. \n\nThis progress is essential to fulfill the user request because now you can begin browsing for the desired item (Logitech G Pro) and add it to your shopping cart. This action helps move you closer to the goal of emptying the cart and adding the specified item. \n\nHowever, the task isn't completed yet, as you still need to locate the Logitech G Pro, add it to the cart, and proceed to checkout."}
