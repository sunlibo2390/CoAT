This allows me to view additional items on the search results page for \"Logitech G Pro.\" However, this action does not directly contribute to emptying the shopping cart or adding the desired product to the cart as requested.\n\nTo make progress towards completing the user request, I would need to either go to the shopping cart and empty it or click on the product listing for the \"Logitech G PRO\" mouse and add it to the cart. Then, I could proceed to checkout. This action of scrolling helps in revealing more options but does not fully address the user's request yet."}
