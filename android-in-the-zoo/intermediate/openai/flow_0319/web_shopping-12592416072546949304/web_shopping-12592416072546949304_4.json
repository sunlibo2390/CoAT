The next step to fulfill your request would be to remove these items from the cart, which would empty the cart.\n\nWhile this action doesn't fully complete your request yet, it sets the stage to remove the existing items and proceed with adding the Logitech G Pro to the cart. After that, you can move forward to the checkout. So, this action has made progress towards your request but hasn't fully completed it yet.",
