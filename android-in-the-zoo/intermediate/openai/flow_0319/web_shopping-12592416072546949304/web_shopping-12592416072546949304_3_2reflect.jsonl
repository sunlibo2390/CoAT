This is a crucial step because to empty the shopping cart, I need to be on the Newegg platform first. However, this action does not directly contribute to emptying the cart yet, as it only brings us to the homepage or search page, depending on the layout. The next necessary steps involve finding and accessing the shopping cart to empty it before proceeding with adding the Logitech G Pro to the cart and selecting checkout. Therefore, while this action moves us toward the user request, it's not yet complete."}
