This shows that the item currently in the cart is a Belkin USB C to USB A cable priced at $11.97. \n\nThis action brings us closer to the user request, which is to add a USB-B cable to the cart. However, the next step will involve searching for and adding the desired USB-B cable to the cart, as it is not yet in the cart. The current screen shows the cart with an item that isn't a USB-B cable, so the task is not yet fully complete."}
