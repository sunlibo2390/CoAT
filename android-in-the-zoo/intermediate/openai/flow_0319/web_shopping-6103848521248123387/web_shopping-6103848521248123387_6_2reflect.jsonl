This action did not directly impact the cart, so the cart remains unchanged.\n\nTo move closer to the user request of clearing the cart, additional steps are needed. Specifically, the user should go to the cart and remove the existing items.\n\nThis action helps by decluttering the screen and may bring the user closer to managing the cart but does not yet clear it. More actions are needed to clear the cart and then add a USB-B to it."}
