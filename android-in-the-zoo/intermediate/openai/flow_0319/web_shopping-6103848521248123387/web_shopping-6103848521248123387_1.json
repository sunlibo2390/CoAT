This action likely took the user back to a previous screen in the Walmart app, possibly the cart or home page. However, this action does not directly address the user request to clear the cart and add a USB-B to it. Additional steps will be needed to open the cart, clear its contents, and search for and add the USB-B to the cart. Therefore, this action has not yet made progress toward completing the user request.",
