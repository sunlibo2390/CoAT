However, the user still needs to select a product and explicitly add it to the cart. Therefore, while the action was necessary to see more options, it has not fully completed the user request yet.

However, it might provide access to necessary navigation options, such as buttons or sections that allow you to clear the cart or search for the USB-B item. \n\nThus, this action has not yet made direct progress towards completing your request, but it could potentially be a step towards reaching the required options. You may need to take further actions, such as accessing the cart or performing a search for the USB-B item.",
