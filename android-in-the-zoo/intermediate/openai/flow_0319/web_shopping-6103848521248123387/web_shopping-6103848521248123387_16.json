However, it hasn't yet achieved the goal of adding a \"usb-b\" item to the cart. Further steps, such as selecting an item and adding it to the cart, are required to complete the user's request.\n\nTherefore, while progress was made in terms of viewing more products, the user request has not yet been fully completed.",
