The user selected free shipping to ZIP code 04785, estimated to arrive by Thursday, Dec 1. A yellow \"Checkout\" button is prominently displayed.

This action does not directly contribute to clearing the cart or adding a USB-B to the cart on Walmart. To progress with the user's request, the next steps would be to either access the Walmart website or app, navigate to the cart section, and then proceed to clear it and add the specified item.",

This action likely took the user back to a previous screen in the Walmart app, possibly the cart or home page. However, this action does not directly address the user request to clear the cart and add a USB-B to it. Additional steps will be needed to open the cart, clear its contents, and search for and add the USB-B to the cart. Therefore, this action has not yet made progress toward completing the user request.",
