However, it hasn't yet achieved the goal of adding a \"usb-b\" item to the cart. Further steps, such as selecting an item and adding it to the cart, are required to complete the user's request.\n\nTherefore, while progress was made in terms of viewing more products, the user request has not yet been fully completed.",

This action does not directly impact the completion of your user request to add a USB-B item to the cart on Walmart.\n\nHowever, this could be a step towards finding the desired item (USB-B) in the search results. Since the current view shows the search results for \"usb-b,\" it is likely you are now able to review more options to find the specific product to add to the cart.\n\nProgress has been made, but to fully complete your request, you would still need to select and add a USB-B item to the cart.",
