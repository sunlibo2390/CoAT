This shows that the item currently in the cart is a Belkin USB C to USB A cable priced at $11.97. \n\nThis action brings us closer to the user request, which is to add a USB-B cable to the cart. However, the next step will involve searching for and adding the desired USB-B cable to the cart, as it is not yet in the cart. The current screen shows the cart with an item that isn't a USB-B cable, so the task is not yet fully complete.",
    "prev_action_result": "By clicking the cancel button located at the top right of the screen, the action dismissed the current overlay or pop-up (likely the promotional offer or app advertisement). This action did not directly impact the cart, so the cart remains unchanged.\n\nTo move closer to the user request of clearing the cart, additional steps are needed. Specifically, the user should go to the cart and remove the existing items.\n\nThis action helps by decluttering the screen and may bring the user closer to managing the cart but does not yet clear it. More actions are needed to clear the cart and then add a USB-B to it.",
