This is a significant step toward completing the user request, as now you have accessed the Walmart website. However, this action does not directly clear the cart or add a USB-B to it. To proceed with the user request, you will need to:\n\n1. Navigate to the cart and clear its contents.\n2. Search for a USB-B cable and add it to the cart.\n\nSo, while this action brought you to the Walmart site, additional steps are required to complete the user\u2019s request."}
