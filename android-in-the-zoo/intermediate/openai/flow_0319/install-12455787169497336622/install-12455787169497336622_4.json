The next step would be to either install the app (if not already installed) or open it, followed by logging in with the username and password you provided.",

The next logical step would be to enter \"Mercado Libre\" into the search bar and proceed with either installing or opening the app, depending on its availability. This action has not yet fully completed the user request, but it has moved the user closer to finding and interacting with the \"Mercado Libre\" app.",
