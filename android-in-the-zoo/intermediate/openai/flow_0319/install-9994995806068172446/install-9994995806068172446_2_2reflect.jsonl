In the current screenshot, you can see that the app \"Lyft\" is not yet visible. This action allows you to explore further apps, which is a necessary step to locate the \"Play Store\" and eventually install the required \"Lyft\" app. However, further interaction is needed to either search for the app in the Play Store or navigate to it directly. Therefore, this action has made some progress, but it hasn't fully completed the user request yet."}
