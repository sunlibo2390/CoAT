It has app icons arranged in a grid, including Google Play, LinkedIn, DuckDuckGo, NewsBreak, Expedia, Speedtest, eBay, Truecaller, ColorNote, Adobe Acrobat, and Indeed Jobs. Below the grid, there are two primary app icons for messaging and Chrome browser. A Google search bar with a voice assistant shortcut is at the bottom.

However, the impact of this action on the user request is limited. Since the user requested to install the \"Lyft - Rideshare, Bikes, Scooters & Transit\" app, it would be more effective to search for the app directly or navigate to the app store. Therefore, while scrolling up might have shown more options, it hasn't directly advanced the task of installing the Lyft app. Further steps like using the search bar would be more effective in completing the request.",
