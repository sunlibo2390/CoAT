In this case, you can now access different features like \"Device folders,\" \"Archive,\" \"Trash,\" and \"Free up space,\" among others. However, there is no direct access to your saved creations visible yet.\n\nTo make progress toward the user request, you would need to select a relevant option from this menu, like \"Device folders\" or another option that may contain the saved photos or creations you are looking for. This action brings you closer to your goal, but further navigation within the menu is required to access the specific creations saved in Google Photos."}
