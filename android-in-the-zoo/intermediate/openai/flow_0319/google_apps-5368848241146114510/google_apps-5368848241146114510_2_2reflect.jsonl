However, the current screen shows that the \"Web & App Activity\" is off, and it offers the option to turn it on for tailored suggestions.\n\nThis action brings us one step closer to the user's request, but the next step should be to enter the search term \"Italian restaurants\" into the search bar to proceed with finding the desired restaurants on Maps. The screen does not show the results yet, so additional input is needed."}
