It displays various options like \"Connected devices\" (for Bluetooth), \"Apps & notifications,\" \"Battery\" (currently at 100%), \"Display\" (for adjusting wallpaper, sleep settings, and font size), \"Sound\" (for volume and Do Not Disturb), and \"Storage\" (with 48% used and 32.62 GB free). These options allow users to manage different aspects of the phone's settings.",
    "action_think": "The user wants to change the appearance of the keyboard, which typically involves going into the 'Languages & input' or a similar section in the settings. Based on the current screen, we need to navigate to the input settings. This is most likely found under 'Apps & notifications' or 'Display' but is more commonly located under a section related to input or language settings, which is currently not visible. Therefore, the next logical step is to click on 'Apps & notifications' to explore further options related to keyboard settings.",

    "prev_action_result": "By scrolling up, the settings menu now displays more options related to the device's functionality, such as \"Battery,\" \"Display,\" and \"Sound.\" This action helps move closer to the user request of changing the keyboard's appearance, as the \"Display\" section is now visible, which may contain settings related to appearance, potentially including keyboard settings.\n\nHowever, it's not directly clear if the keyboard settings are accessible from this menu. To fulfill the user request, additional navigation might be needed to locate the specific keyboard settings (likely under \"Language & Input\" or a similar category). So, this action has made partial progress, but further steps are necessary to change the keyboard's appearance.",
