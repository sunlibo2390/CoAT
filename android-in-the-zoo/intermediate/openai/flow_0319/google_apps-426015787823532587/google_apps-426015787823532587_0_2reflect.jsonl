This action doesn't directly relate to changing the keyboard's appearance, as the settings for keyboard customization are typically found in the device's settings or within the keyboard app itself. Therefore, this action does not make direct progress toward the user request of changing the keyboard's looks.\n\nTo proceed with the user's request, the next step should be to access the Settings app or the specific keyboard settings."}
