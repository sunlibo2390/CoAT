The direct consequence of this action is that new options are now visible, such as \"Accounts,\" \"Accessibility,\" and \"Google,\" which might offer settings related to the keyboard or display preferences.\n\nHowever, this action does not directly influence the completion of the user request to change the keyboard's appearance. The action moved the user to different settings categories, but it is not clear if these settings are directly related to customizing the keyboard look. To achieve the desired change, the user likely needs to access the \"Language & Input\" settings or a similar section under \"System\" or \"Google\" settings, which would contain the keyboard customization options.\n\nThus, while this action brings the user closer to relevant settings, further navigation to a specific keyboard-related section is still required to complete the user request."}
