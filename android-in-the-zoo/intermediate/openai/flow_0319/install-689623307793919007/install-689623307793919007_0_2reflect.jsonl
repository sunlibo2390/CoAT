This action doesn't directly contribute to uninstalling the \"Lyft\" app, but it is a necessary step in the process, as it provides access to the app icons, which are required to locate and uninstall the app. The next step would be to find the \"Lyft\" app on the home screen or app drawer, then proceed to uninstall it. Therefore, this action helps make progress toward the user request, but further steps are needed to complete the uninstallation."}
