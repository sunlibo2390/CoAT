This action is an important step towards fulfilling the user request, as it allows you to search for the \"Lyft\" app specifically. However, the next step would be to type in the name of the app, \"Lyft,\" in the search bar to find it, and from there, you would be able to uninstall it. \n\nCurrently, this action is a step forward but hasn't yet directly led to the uninstallation of the Lyft app."}
