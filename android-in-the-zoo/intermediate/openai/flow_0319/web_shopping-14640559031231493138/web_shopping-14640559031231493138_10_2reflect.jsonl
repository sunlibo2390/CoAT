To fulfill the user request, the next step should involve navigating to the shopping cart or continuing to search for the Razer Nari if it hasn't been completed yet.\n\nIn summary, the action has not yet progressed toward the user request. You need to proceed to view the shopping cart or finalize the search and add the item to the cart."}
