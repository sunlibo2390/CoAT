Based on the user request to view the shopping cart, this action does not directly bring the user closer to their goal. It does not show the shopping cart or search for \"razer nari\" on Amazon. To progress towards completing the user request, the next action should either focus on accessing the shopping cart or performing a search for the desired item. Therefore, this action does not significantly progress the task of viewing the shopping cart or adding the item to it."}
