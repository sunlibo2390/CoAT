The current screen shows a video from Taylor Swift, which indicates that YouTube is now actively running. However, this action does not directly fulfill your request to play the new Justin Bieber video, as it is currently displaying content unrelated to Justin Bieber.\n\nTo proceed toward completing your request, you would need to search for the Justin Bieber video or navigate to the relevant video. Therefore, while this action was necessary to access YouTube, further steps are needed to find and play the specific video you requested."}
