This indicates that the Photos app is set up but does not currently display any saved photos. \n\nAlthough the Photos app has opened, it does not show any of the user's saved creations yet, so the user has not yet seen their saved photos. To complete the request, the user would need to either upload photos or navigate to settings to manage syncing. Therefore, this action has not yet fully progressed towards the user's request to view saved creations."}
