As a result, Google Photos is now set to sync photos and videos from the user's account. \n\nThe current screenshot shows the \"No photos\" message, indicating that there are no photos yet available in the app. This suggests that no photos have been uploaded or synced yet.\n\nThe action of confirming the sync settings is a necessary step for enabling photo uploads, but it hasn't yet resulted in any visible photos in the app, meaning no progress has been made towards the user's request of seeing saved creations. Further action, such as uploading photos or taking a picture, is required to see the photos in Google Photos."}
