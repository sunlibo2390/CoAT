It seems the user has not uploaded any photos yet or they are not visible in the app. The 'Back up & sync' settings are visible, indicating the app is ready to back up photos. The next logical action is to confirm the settings to enable the backup, or to check for any photos already in the app. Since there is a 'Confirm' button visible, I will proceed with that action to confirm the current settings.",

Further action, such as uploading photos or taking a picture, is required to see the photos in Google Photos.",
