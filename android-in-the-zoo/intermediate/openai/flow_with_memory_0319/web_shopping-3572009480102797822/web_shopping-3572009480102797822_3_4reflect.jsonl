This action has moved the process forward by opening the shopping cart menu, but it has not yet shown the cart's contents or allowed you to add items to the cart.\n\nTo fully complete the user's request, the next step would be to either open the cart or use the search bar to find \"MacBook Air\" and add it to the cart."}
