It also offers two configuration options, with or without AppleCare+, affecting the price. There is a note indicating only 13 units are left in stock.

    "action_think": "According to the user's request, I need to add the MacBook Air to the shopping cart on Amazon. However, the current screenshot does not provide a clear indication of whether the website being used is Amazon. I need to confirm that this is indeed Amazon and if so, look for an option to add the MacBook Air to the cart. Typically, this would involve clicking on a button such as 'Add to Cart' or similar. The screenshot shows a product page, but it does not explicitly show an 'Add to Cart' button or any indication of Amazon branding. If this is Amazon, the action to add the MacBook Air to the cart might be by scrolling down, as the action needed may be further down the page, off-screen. If it is not Amazon, we have to navigate back to the search results and choose an appropriate link that corresponds to Amazon's website.",
