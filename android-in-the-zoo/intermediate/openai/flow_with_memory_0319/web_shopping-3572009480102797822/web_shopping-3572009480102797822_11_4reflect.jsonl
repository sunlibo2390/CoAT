This action doesn't directly show the shopping cart, but it does allow the user to make further decisions about the product's configuration before adding it to the cart.\n\nHowever, the request to view the shopping cart and add the MacBook Air to it hasn't yet been completed. You may need to navigate to the shopping cart page or press the \"Add to Cart\" button to fulfill the user\u2019s request. Therefore, this action does not make significant progress toward completing the request."}
