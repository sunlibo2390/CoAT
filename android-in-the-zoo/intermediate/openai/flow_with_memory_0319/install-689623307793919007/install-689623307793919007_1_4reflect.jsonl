This action may have provided more context or visibility for locating the \"Lyft - Rideshare, Bikes, Scooters & Transit\" app.\n\nWhile this scroll-up action may have brought the app closer into view, it does not directly complete the user's request of uninstalling the app. The next step would be selecting the \"Lyft\" app and then proceeding with the uninstallation process. Therefore, this action has made partial progress by revealing more content but hasn't fully addressed the user request yet."}
