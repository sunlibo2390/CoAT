This action does not directly contribute to uninstalling the \"Lyft - Rideshare, Bikes, Scooters & Transit\" app. To uninstall the app, we would need to navigate to the app list or settings where you can select and remove the app. This step is part of the process but does not yet make progress toward completing the user request. Further actions, such as accessing the app list or settings, are needed to continue towards uninstalling the Lyft app."}
