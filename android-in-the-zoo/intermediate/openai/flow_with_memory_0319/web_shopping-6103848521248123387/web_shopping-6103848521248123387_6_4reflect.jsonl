As a result, the page now returns to the main Walmart homepage, with the search bar active and ready to initiate a new search or action.\n\nThis action does not directly progress the user request of clearing the cart. However, it might be part of the process to allow the user to start a fresh search for \"usb-b\" and then add the item to the cart. Thus, the user is now in a state where they can proceed with searching for \"usb-b\" to fulfill their request, but the cart has not been cleared yet."}
