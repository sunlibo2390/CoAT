This is evident from the cart icon in the top right corner, which now shows one item worth $44.99. \n\nThis action has made progress towards the user request because adding the USB-B cable to the cart is part of the task. However, the first part of the request, which is clearing the cart, has not been completed yet. If the cart previously contained other items, they still need to be removed to fully complete the request."}
