However, this action does not directly impact the user's request to clear the cart or add a \"usb-b\" item to the cart.\n\nTo make progress toward the user request, the next steps would be to either navigate to the cart to clear the items or search for and add the desired \"usb-b\" product to the cart. Thus, while scrolling up reveals more options, it has not yet directly contributed to fulfilling the user request."}
