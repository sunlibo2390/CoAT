However, based on the action described, it does not directly assist in clearing the cart or adding a USB-B to the cart on Walmart. \n\nTo make progress toward the user request, you would typically need to navigate to the cart section and either clear the cart or add the USB-B to it. Scrolling up may have simply refreshed the view or allowed access to other items, but it doesn't directly facilitate clearing the cart or adding the item. More specific actions related to the cart are needed for progress."}
