Since the user has requested to clear the cart and add a USB-B product, the next step is to ensure the cart is visible or accessible. Once the cart is visible, I can proceed to clear it. Then, I'll search for the USB-B product and add it to the cart. I need to first confirm if the cart is accessible or if I need to navigate to it.",

Further steps, such as navigating to the cart, clearing items, and searching for a USB-B, would be necessary to fully complete the user request. \n\nIn conclusion, this action is part of the necessary process but does not yet fully meet the user request.",
