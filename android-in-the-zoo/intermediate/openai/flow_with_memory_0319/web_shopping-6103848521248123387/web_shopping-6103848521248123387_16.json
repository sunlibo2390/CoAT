The main content displays a sponsored product: a Monoprice USB Type-A to USB Type-B 2.0 cable (6 feet, 5-pack) priced at $44.99, with ratings and a shipping estimate.

If the cart previously contained other items, they still need to be removed to fully complete the request.",

However, this action does not directly impact the user's request to clear the cart or add a \"usb-b\" item to the cart.\n\nTo make progress toward the user request, the next steps would be to either navigate to the cart to clear the items or search for and add the desired \"usb-b\" product to the cart. Thus, while scrolling up reveals more options, it has not yet directly contributed to fulfilling the user request.",
