This action directly clears the cart, which was necessary to meet the user request of clearing the cart on Walmart.\n\nHowever, this action alone does not complete the second part of the user request, which is to add a USB-B cable to the cart. The cart is now empty, and the next step would be to search for and add the USB-B cable to the cart to fulfill the entire request."}
