        "Thought": "The user has requested to clear the cart and then to add a USB-B cable to the cart on Walmart. From the history actions, I see that the user has already attempted to clear the cart by clicking on the 'Remove' button previously, but it is not clear if the cart is currently empty. The user has clicked on the 'Add' button for the USB-B cable. The current screen shows the product page for a Monoprice USB Type-A to USB Type-B 2.0 Cable with the quantity set to 1, which suggests that the last action was likely adding this item to the cart. To confirm that the user's request has been fulfilled, I need to first verify that the cart has been cleared, and then check that the USB-B cable is indeed added to the cart. The appropriate next step is to navigate to the cart to check the current items in it.",
