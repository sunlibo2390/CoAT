This action has not directly brought you closer to your request of searching for seafood restaurants on Google Maps. The current screen does show the Google Maps app, but it requires further interaction, such as opening the Maps app and entering the search query for seafood restaurants.\n\nSo, this action has not yet made significant progress toward the user request, as additional steps are needed to initiate the search."}
