In the last screenshot, you can see the items in the cart: a Razer Huntsman Elite keyboard and a Dell Alienware laptop, with a total of $1,668.99.\n\nHowever, there has been no direct indication of removing any items from the cart yet, so the action of emptying the cart has not yet been performed. To complete your request, you would need to remove the existing items and add the Logitech G Pro to the cart. You can also proceed to checkout once the desired item is added. \n\nThis action has made partial progress, as you have accessed the cart, but further steps are needed to empty it and add the requested item."}
