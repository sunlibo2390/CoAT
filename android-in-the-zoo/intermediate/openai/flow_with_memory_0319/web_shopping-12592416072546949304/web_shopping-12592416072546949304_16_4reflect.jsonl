From here, you can proceed to empty the cart, add the Logitech G Pro to it, and eventually move forward with the checkout process.\n\nHowever, the current screenshot only shows the protection plan options for an item already added to the cart, not the cart's contents. You will need to proceed with the next steps to ensure that the cart is emptied and the Logitech G Pro is added, as the next step in your request."}
