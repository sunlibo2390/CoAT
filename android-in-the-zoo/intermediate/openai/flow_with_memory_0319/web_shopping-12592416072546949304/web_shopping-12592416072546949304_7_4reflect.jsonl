This is the initial step toward proceeding with your user request. It helps by allowing you to continue browsing for items, which is essential for adding the \"Logitech G Pro\" to your cart. \n\nHowever, since your cart is currently empty, as shown in the previous screenshot, you will need to search for the Logitech G Pro and add it to your cart manually. This action has taken you a step closer to fulfilling the request, but the task is not yet completed. You'll need to find the Logitech G Pro, add it to the cart, and then proceed to checkout."}
