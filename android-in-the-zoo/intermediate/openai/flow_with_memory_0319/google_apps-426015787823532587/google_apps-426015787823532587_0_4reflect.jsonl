This action brings the user closer to the \"change keyboard looks\" task because it likely exposes more settings or apps related to keyboard customization. However, it seems that more steps are required to directly access the specific keyboard settings to change its appearance. The next action would likely involve selecting an app or settings related to the keyboard, such as \"Settings\" or \"Google Keyboard\" options, to proceed with modifying the keyboard's look."}
