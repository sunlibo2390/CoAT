On the current screen, the options available are related to general device settings, including email account setup, network & internet, and apps & notifications.\n\nThis action has made progress toward the user's request to change the keyboard looks, as the next logical step would be to access the \"Language & input\" or similar section under the settings menu. Here, the user can find options to modify the appearance and settings of the keyboard. Therefore, the action has initiated the process of changing the keyboard looks, but further steps are still required."}
