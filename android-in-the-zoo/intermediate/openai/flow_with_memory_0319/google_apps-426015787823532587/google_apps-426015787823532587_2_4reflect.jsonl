On the current screen, the \"Display\" option is now at the top, which may include options for customizing the keyboard's appearance, such as themes or size.\n\nThis action makes progress towards the user's request to change the keyboard looks, as it potentially leads to settings where visual changes to the keyboard can be made. However, further navigation into the \"Display\" or related sections will be needed to directly modify the keyboard's appearance."}
