Since the current screen displays a general settings menu without those specific options, I will need to locate the appropriate section for keyboard settings. The most likely path to access this would be through the 'System' section at the bottom of the screen. I will first open the 'System' section and look for 'Languages & input' or any related keyboard settings.", "Future Action Plan": ["Click on 'System' to open the next settings section."]}}
