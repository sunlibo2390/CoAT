This action brings the screen closer to completing the user request because the full cart is now visible, which is essential before proceeding to add the Razer Nari headset.\n\nHowever, the next steps to fulfill the user request (searching for Razer Nari and adding it to the cart) still need to be carried out. The current screen doesn't show any search results or an option to add new items to the cart, so the user needs to search for the headset and complete the addition manually. This action helps by bringing the shopping cart into view but does not directly address adding the Razer Nari to the cart yet."}
