This action is necessary because the user request requires accessing the shopping cart and searching for a specific product on Amazon, which can only be done through the Amazon app.\n\nHowever, the current screen shows the Target app, not Amazon, and the cart in this app contains a Duracell battery pack. This indicates that the last action did not successfully take the user to Amazon, and there is no progress toward completing the user request at this stage.\n\nTo make progress, I would need to ensure the Amazon app is opened and navigate to the cart as instructed."}
