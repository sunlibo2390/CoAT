This action does not directly bring you closer to finding a place where you can buy a beach cooler. However, this could potentially be the first step in searching for an app or website related to shopping, such as the Play Store or a specific online retailer. To make progress toward the user request, the next step should likely involve opening a shopping app, such as Amazon, or using a search engine to find the right stores or beach coolers."
